 * it faithfully persisted on every navigation was written and never read. The
 * app now reopens where the user left off — but only when that destination is
 * still reachable, because a persisted view that no longer resolves would
 * strand the user on an empty shell with no rendered view.
 *
 * Rules, in order:
 *  - nothing persisted (fresh install, or a backend that never wrote the key)
 *    ⇒ `"welcome"`;
 *  - `mod:<id>` aliases collapse to their canonical route via
 *    {@link normalizeView} (e.g. `mod:dictation` → `dictation`);
 *  - a plain module view (`mod:quality`) survives only while that module is
 *    enabled — `isModuleEnabled` also answers `false` for modules that have
 *    since been removed from the registry;
 *  - a core view survives only if {@link ROUTE_REGISTRY} still declares it, and
 *    — for routes backed by a module, like Dictation — only while that module
 *    is enabled;
 *  - anything else (a retired route id such as the legacy `"dashboard"` or the
 *    removed `"cost_dashboard"`, junk, a future id from a newer build) ⇒
 *    `"welcome"`.
 *
 * The module-enabled check is injected rather than imported so this stays a
 * pure function and `appStore` keeps no dependency on `moduleStore`.
