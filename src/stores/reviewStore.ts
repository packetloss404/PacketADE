 * The canonical review surface's store (consensus P1-8).
 *
 * Owns two things:
 *
 * 1. Ephemeral open/focus state for the single multibuffer review panel
 *    that the "N files · +X/−Y · Review" bar above the composer expands
 *    into. Replaces the old `diffPaneStore` slide-out state. Intentionally
 *    not persisted — the panel always reopens closed after a restart.
 *
 * 2. The persisted per-file "Viewed" slice (GitHub-PR-style checkbox).
 *    Replaces the old `useReviewedDiffs` hand-rolled pub/sub + unbounded
 *    localStorage map. Keyed `conversationId → path → signature`, where
 *    the signature captures the edit chain the user acknowledged — a new
 *    edit to the same file changes the signature, so the file drops back
 *    to unviewed (exactly GitHub's "changed since you viewed it" reset).
 *    Bounded the same way composer drafts are: `clearConversation` runs
 *    from agentTaskStore's delete/cleanup path.
