/**
 * Durable write-through mirror for the webview's `localStorage`.
 *
 * ## The defect this closes
 *
 * Tauri scopes the webview profile — and therefore `localStorage` — to a
 * directory derived from the **bundle identifier**. On Windows that is
 * `%LOCALAPPDATA%\<identifier>\EBWebView\Default\Local Storage\leveldb`;
 * verified directly on the maintainer's machine, where
 * `com.packetade.desktop` and `com.packetbench.desktop` each own a separate
 * `EBWebView\Default\Local Storage` tree.
 *
 * The 2026-08-26 rename moved the identifier from `com.packetade.desktop` to
 * `com.packetbench.desktop`, so the renamed build came up against an empty
 * store and every `packetbench:*` key looked deleted. `storage-migration.ts`
 * cannot fix that: it runs *inside* the new, already-empty store.
 *
 * The Rust data dir (`~/.packetbench`) is keyed by the user's home directory,
 * not by the bundle identifier, so a copy kept there survives any identifier
 * change. This module keeps that copy in sync and refills `localStorage` from
 * it at boot.
 *
 * ## Design, and what was rejected
 *
 * **Rejected: move persisted state to async Tauri-backed storage.** The
 * obvious fix is to stop using `localStorage` and read state over IPC. But
 * ~40 stores hydrate synchronously at module-evaluation time; making them
 * async would move every one of them to a post-first-paint hydration and
 * change initial-render behaviour app-wide. That is an enormous blast radius
 * for a problem that is really just "the store came up empty once".
 *
 * **Rejected: mirror at the `loadFromStorage` / `saveToStorage` seam.** That
 * seam is imported by 29 files, but it is not the only writer: there are ~25
 * further direct `localStorage.setItem` call sites across `src/components`,
 * `src/lib` and `src/stores`, plus the two stores that use Zustand's `persist`
 * middleware (`issueFlightMirrorStore`, `packetAgentStore`), which writes
 * through its own storage adapter. Hooking the seam would have mirrored a
 * fraction of the keyspace and silently lost the rest.
 *
 * **Chosen: intercept the `Storage` write methods, snapshot the whole
 * `packetbench:*` keyspace, and flush it debounced.** Reads and writes stay
 * exactly as synchronous as they are today — nothing in any store changes —
 * and coverage is total by construction: every writer goes through
 * `setItem`/`removeItem`/`clear`, including Zustand's `persist` middleware and
 * every component that never imported the seam. See
 * {@link interceptStorageWrites} for why the prototype, not the instance, is
 * the patch point.
 *
 * ## Invariants
 *
 * - **`localStorage` always wins.** Restore fills *gaps* only; a key present
 *   in the live store is never overwritten from the mirror. The mirror is a
 *   derived copy, never an authority.
 * - **Snapshot, not deltas.** Each flush sends the complete `packetbench:*`
 *   keyspace, so deletions propagate and the mirror cannot accumulate keys the
 *   app has stopped using.
 * - **The writer only starts after a successful read.** If the mirror cannot
 *   be loaded, the writer stays off — otherwise a failed read on a fresh
 *   origin would flush an empty snapshot over a perfectly good mirror, turning
 *   a transient IPC error into permanent data loss.
 * - **Inert without Tauri.** Under Vitest (no Tauri at all) and any plain
 *   browser context, every entry point is a no-op that resolves. Nothing here
 *   ever throws or leaves a floating rejection.
 *
 * ## Write amplification
 *
 * A naive mirror would cost one IPC round trip per keystroke in stores that
 * persist drafts. Four things bound it:
 *
 * 1. A trailing {@link DEBOUNCE_MS} debounce with a {@link MAX_DEBOUNCE_MS}
 *    ceiling, so a continuous burst still lands at least that often and a
 *    crash can lose at most that window of changes.
 * 2. Flushes are serialized on a promise chain, so a slow write cannot stack
 *    up concurrent IPC calls.
 * 3. An identical-content check: if the serialized snapshot matches the last
 *    one written, the IPC call is skipped entirely.
 * 4. Size budgets ({@link MAX_VALUE_BYTES}, {@link MAX_TOTAL_BYTES}) keep a
 *    runaway cache key from turning every flush into a multi-megabyte write.
