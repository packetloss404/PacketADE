/**
 * Host-OS detection for the webview.
 *
 * Tauri does not ship `@tauri-apps/plugin-os` in this app, so the two places
 * that already needed the host OS each rolled their own `navigator.userAgent`
 * regex (`DictationView.formatAccelerator`, `KeyboardShortcutsCard` — both
 * only asking "is this a Mac?" to label a modifier key). This module is the
 * place to add to rather than growing a third copy.
 *
 * Prefers `navigator.userAgentData.platform`, which WebView2 and Chromium
 * report as a clean `"Windows"` / `"macOS"` / `"Linux"`; falls back to the
 * user-agent string, which every runtime has. Both reads are wrapped because
 * a `navigator` can be absent or throwing in a test environment, and a
 * platform probe must never be the thing that takes a settings card down.
