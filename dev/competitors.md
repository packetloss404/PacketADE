# PacketADE — Competitor Landscape

Last updated: 2026-07-27
Scope: desktop/local agentic development environments and multi-agent coding-CLI orchestrators —
the category PacketADE competes in. Compiled from read-only web research (fan-out subagent team).
Figures are vendor/third-party-reported unless noted; treat funding/valuation/ARR as approximate.

- [`bridgemind/swarm-orchestration-plan.md`](./bridgemind/swarm-orchestration-plan.md) — PacketADE's own swarm response (mostly shipped)

## The one-line thesis

The category has converged on a single shape: **wrap external coding CLIs (Claude Code, Codex,
Gemini CLI, …) in a desktop/TUI/cloud shell, isolate each with a git worktree (or container), and
add a diff/review + dispatch surface.** Agent intelligence is commoditized; the product is the
management layer. **On the axis PacketADE optimizes — provider identity + auth transport as a
first-class, badged abstraction — essentially nobody else competes.** Everyone delegates auth to
whatever CLI you installed.

## Master comparison

## Where each stands (one paragraph each)

**BridgeMind / BridgeSpace** — The closest overall analog: same Tauri2/Rust ADE shape with a 16-pane
grid, worktrees, Kanban dispatch, role-based orchestration (BridgeSwarm), shared memory, MCP spine,
and Whisper voice. Solo-founder, build-in-public, ~$201K ARR, targets *non-coders/vibe-coders*.
BridgeSpace now exposes custom Agent prompts and Settings API Keys, but current public material still
does not establish one unified provider/auth/transport contract comparable to PacketADE's. Full brief:
[`bridgemind/bridgespace-competitive-brief.md`](./bridgemind/bridgespace-competitive-brief.md).

**Warp** — Biggest and best-funded (~$73M, Sequoia). Native Rust terminal repositioned as an "ADE";
runs its own multi-provider agent *and* wraps external CLIs, with worktrees, parallel tabs, native
code review, and MCP. Auth is account-credit-centric with API-key-only BYOK — no OAuth-subscription
login for its own agent and no provider-identity UI. The rival most worth watching on UX/scale.

**Cursor Cloud (Anysphere)** — The scale incumbent (~$4B ARR, ~$29B+ valuation). Own proprietary
agent stack, cloud-VM isolation, `/multitask` sub-agents, deep Slack/GitHub/Linear integration. Pure
single-vendor funnel: you authenticate to Cursor, models are abstracted behind its routing/credits,
and BYO keys don't even work for cloud agents. The inverse of PacketADE's provider-neutral thesis.

**AgentsRoom** — The richest *orchestration* peer and closest on provider breadth: 8 CLIs, per-agent
provider with mid-conversation switching, a **React-Flow visual team editor** with 14 roles, an
MCP-based `team_*` handoff protocol, cheaper-model QA delegation, one-click role "morphing," plus a
real iOS/Android companion. Electron. Deliberately **never touches credentials** — zero in-app auth
visibility. Out-orchestrates and out-mobilizes PacketADE; PacketADE out-abstracts it on providers/auth.

**Conductor** — Closest well-funded incumbent (YC S24, $22M A, ~6 people). macOS-only, best-in-class
native polish, worktree-per-workspace, wraps 4 harnesses. Has a real auth surface (CLI-auth-vs-API-key
toggle + status readout) but delegates identity to each CLI — no provider modeling or badges, no MCP.
The bar to beat on UX; shallower than PacketADE on auth/provider depth.

**Superset** — Breadth leader (12+ CLIs) with an agent-facing MCP server (27 workspace tools) and a
real team/enterprise pricing ladder. macOS-only, ELv2 source-available, tiny early team. Pure
BYO-keys with no provider-auth modeling. Its coverage makes PacketADE's 8 rows look narrow on
*count*, but PacketADE's auth abstraction is a different (and absent-here) axis.

**Nimbalyst (ex-Crystal)** — Crystal *pioneered the desktop worktree-parallel-sessions pattern* that
is now the category's shared DNA; its free + MIT successor Nimbalyst adds a session kanban, inline AI
diffs, WYSIWYG artifact editors, and a mobile companion. Electron, narrow provider set (Claude
Code + Codex), no auth modeling. Closest desktop analog; edge is visual editors, not providers.

**Claude Squad** — The terminal-purist: a Go TUI multiplexer over tmux + worktrees, agent-agnostic
via a profiles system, AGPL-3.0. No GUI, kanban, memory, voice, MCP, or Windows-native support. Its
generic-CLI-profile model is instructive; its auth is bare env-vars.

**Sculptor (Imbue)** — Strongest *isolation* story: a real Docker container per agent (user-owned,
local, free), with mid-session Claude model switching, a Skills system, and a CI Babysitter.
Single-vendor (Claude only), macOS/Linux, research-preview. PacketADE's closest philosophical rival
on local user-owned isolation — but isolates harder while abstracting providers less.

**Omnara** — Owns the **mobile/remote/voice** dimension PacketADE doesn't touch: a control-plane
overlay that mirrors and steers your local Claude Code/Codex sessions from phone, watch, web, or CLI,
with a flagship 2-way voice mode. No isolation of its own; thin provider layer. A complement more
than a head-to-head — and a clear gap in PacketADE's coverage.

**Vibe Kanban (Bloop)** — The canonical "kanban for agents" (YC-backed), now **dead as a product**
(shut Apr 2026, Apache-2.0 community fork). Local web UI over a Rust+SQLite server, 10+ CLIs, worktree
per card, inline diff review, preview browser, MCP. The direct reference point for PacketADE's Flight
Deck worktree-attempt model — with no provider/auth abstraction.

**Terragon** — Cloud fire-and-forget background orchestrator, also **dead** (shut Jan 2026, OSS
snapshot). Ran each agent in a cloud sandbox container and auto-opened PRs. Notably the *only* peer
besides PacketADE to model a subscription-vs-API-key split — but centralized creds in its cloud and
had no live badges. Validates the auth axis while showing the cloud-centralized version is fragile.

## Synthesis

### Common pattern (category DNA)
1. **Wrap external CLIs, don't build the agent** — everyone except Warp and Cursor.
2. **Git worktrees as the default isolation primitive** — Sculptor (Docker) and Terragon/Cursor
   (cloud sandboxes/VMs) are the outliers.
3. **Parallel attempts + a diff/review/merge surface** is the core loop.
4. **"Bring your own login/keys"** — auth is uniformly delegated to the installed CLI. **No tool
   treats auth identity/transport as a first-class modeled concept.**
5. **Rapid consolidation/mortality** — Terragon (Jan '26), Crystal→Nimbalyst (Feb '26), Bloop/Vibe
   Kanban (Apr '26) all died or changed hands within one quarter.

### Differentiation battlegrounds
- **Orchestration quality** — top axis. AgentsRoom (visual team editor + MCP handoff), BridgeSwarm
  (roles + ownership + gates), and Warp (task-decomposing harness) lead; most others just launch
  parallel independent agents.
- **Isolation model** — worktree (default) vs container (Sculptor) vs cloud VM (Cursor/Terragon).
  "How safe is a bad agent?" is a real wedge.
- **Provider breadth + switching** — Superset (12+), AgentsRoom (8, mid-conv), Warp (5/40+ models).
- **Auth/provider identity** — **wide open; only PacketADE and (defunct) Terragon even attempt it.**
- **Memory** — near-empty lane; only BridgeMemory and AgentsRoom's project memory market it.
- **Voice** — thin field: Omnara, AgentsRoom, BridgeVoice, PacketADE's Dictation.
- **Mobile/remote steering** — Omnara, AgentsRoom, Cursor, BridgeAgent.
- **MCP** — surprisingly under-marketed; Warp, Superset, AgentsRoom, BridgeMCP foreground it.

### Where PacketADE is genuinely differentiated
1. **Provider/auth-type as a first-class, badged concept** — unique. OAuth/subscription vs API-key,
   live refresh-token-aware badges (`ready | login_required | missing_key`), filesystem auth-watcher.
2. **Dual transport behind one event contract** — in-process `LlmProvider` (Claude/OpenAI API,
   MiniMax, OpenRouter, Ollama) *and* a versioned Node sidecar (Anthropic sub, Codex sub, OpenAI
   Agents SDK), both emitting `api-agent:*`. No peer runs both raw-API and subscription-CLI providers
   behind one contract.
3. **Layered work hierarchy (Flights above issues/sessions)** — most peers stop at card→agent→worktree→diff.
4. **Breadth of integrated surfaces** — API-agent chat tiles + PTY terminals + memory + dictation +
   MCP + cost analytics in one Tauri app; few peers span this range.

### Gaps PacketADE should weigh (where peers are ahead)
- **Orchestration depth** — AgentsRoom's visual team editor + MCP handoff and BridgeSwarm's gates set
  a higher bar than parallel attempts. (PacketADE's [`swarm-orchestration-plan.md`](./bridgemind/swarm-orchestration-plan.md)
  already ships roles/ownership/collision/feed; auto-reassignment escalation is the remaining gap.)
- **Mobile/remote/voice steering** — owned by Omnara/AgentsRoom/Cursor; PacketADE is desktop-only.
- **Native-Mac polish & funding** — Conductor/Warp/Cursor out-resource us on UX.
- **Provider count** — Superset (12+) and AgentsRoom (8 CLIs) exceed our 8 rows on raw count (though
  not on auth depth).

### Bottom line
UI/worktree/kanban/diff parity is table-stakes and no longer differentiates anyone. PacketADE's
durable moats are **provider/auth abstraction, dual transport, memory, and MCP breadth** — precisely
the lanes the rest of the field under-invests in, and aligned to a *professional-engineer* audience
that BridgeMind/Warp's vibe-coder positioning doesn't serve.
