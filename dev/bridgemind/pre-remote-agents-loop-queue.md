# Approved Loop Queue Before Remote Agents

Status: **locally converged; environment/external-runtime gates isolated;
Remote Agents boundary remains closed**

Prepared: 2026-07-28

Release baseline: **v0.10.2**

## Purpose

This is the single run order for PacketADE product decisions made during the
BridgeMind/BridgeSpace review. It replaces repeated “which loop next?”
questions. After the user gives the one-time confirmation, execute the runnable
slices in order, keep each canonical ledger current, and continue automatically
from one completed slice to the next.

Do not start this queue merely because this file exists. The current stopping
point is the confirmation gate below.

## Execution rules

- The canonical acceptance conditions remain in each linked loop; this file
  orders them but does not weaken them.
- Close a slice only after its named tests and documentation reconciliation
  pass.
- A hardware, host, signing-credential, published-package, or sibling-product
  dependency becomes `gated` with exact evidence and pickup instructions. It
  does not make a different independent slice pass, and it does not prevent
  safe later source work.
- Preserve existing permission, Reviewer Gate, protected-branch, conflict, and
  bounded-autonomy hard stops. Loop execution is not authority to publish
  externally, change secrets, weaken security policy, or imitate PacketAgent.
- Update [`../../backlog.md`](../../backlog.md),
  [`../../ROADMAP.md`](../../ROADMAP.md), [`../README.md`](../README.md), and
  the active ledger after every completed lane.
- Run the relevant focused tests during each slice and the full frontend,
  sidecar, Rust compile, and packaged gates at convergence.

## Dictation follow-on slices

The initial DV1–DV10 repair is complete. These IDs make the remaining backlog
executable without pretending that this machine currently has an active
microphone or that unavailable platforms were tested.

| **DV13** | Global-shortcut trust                 | Add an explicit enable switch, conflict/readiness test, serialized rebinding, and a safer default that does not claim `Ctrl+Shift+V` unconditionally.                                          | complete                                                      |

| **DV16** | Structured private telemetry          | Return capture format, detected language, duration, model-load/inference timing, and warnings without logging transcript or dictionary contents.                                               | complete                                                      |

## Cross-repository and external lanes

- **PacketCode:** its source integration is complete. PacketADE may run its
  compatibility smoke when a published PacketCode build exists, but remaining
  PacketCode implementation and signing work stays in
  `D:\projects\packetcode`; this queue does not mutate that sibling repository.
- **PacketAgent:** active in its own repository and Codex project. W9 is now
  published and the PacketADE Flight consumer source is implemented; live
  close/restart continuation, missing approval-response contract, and richer
  source/attention/artifact slices remain in the handoff ledger. This queue
  does not rebuild the always-on worker.
- **Signing and updater:** record unsigned local installers as local build
  evidence. Public trusted distribution remains gated on Windows/macOS signing
  credentials and updater configuration.

## Decisions that intentionally create no loop

- No BridgeBench / Flight Bakeoff or multi-model leaderboard.
- No BridgeShot / screenshot-OCR product.
- Production-signal monitoring is not now.
- The deleted autonomous Flight Planner v1 remains deleted.

## Confirmation boundary

**Confirmed by the user on 2026-07-28. Lanes 1–6 are active.**

The confirmation authorizes the ordered, in-repository implementation and
verification work above without another product-choice prompt between slices.
It does not authorize external releases, secret changes, destructive cleanup,
protected-branch bypass, or work inside the PacketCode/PacketAgent repositories.
Stop only for a genuine blocking dependency or a new decision that would
materially change the approved product scope.
