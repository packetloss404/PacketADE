# 10 - Pause and Resumption Record

**Status: HISTORICAL RECORD — program active; Sprint 0 completed 2026-09-01.**
The owner resumed the program on 2026-08-27 after an eleven-day pause. For live
status, start with `README.md` and `09-open-decisions.md`; use this document for
the pause/resumption history, invariants, and pickup context.

The pause is preserved below as history, not as noise: it was a deliberate
sequencing decision made during a blocker review, not neglect, and the reasons
recorded in §3 are still the reasons — they were overtaken, not refuted.

---

## 1. The decisions

### 1.1 The pause (2026-08-16) — history

On 2026-08-16 the owner paused the Remote Agents program deliberately, during
a blocker-review session, rather than by neglect. Scope of the pause:

- **No Sprint 0.** No `remoteagents/` workspace, no relay routes, no PWA
  scaffold, no `src-tauri/src/commands/remote_agents/` module got created.
- **The auth decision was parked, not pressured.** It was the last blocking
  owner decision; while paused it converted from "blocking P1" to "first
  action of the pickup runbook."
- **Planning artifacts were frozen as-is.** Docs 01–09 remained the design of
  record; nothing in them was invalidated by the pause.

### 1.2 The resumption (2026-08-27)

On 2026-08-27 the owner unpaused the program. Three decisions were recorded
the same day:

- **The program is live again.** Sprint 0 in `06-implementation-plan.md` is
  once more the next step, gated only by the auth decision (§1.3).
- **PacketRelay belongs to PacketBench.** The standalone Rust relay at
  `D:\projects\packetrelay` is no longer shared with, or driven by, Syndicate.
  It is PacketBench's infrastructure and **Remote Agents is its only
  consumer**. Nothing else in the Packet\* family drives its roadmap.
- **The relay's deployment target is Railway.** This replaces the Google
  Cloud Run deployment the relay ran while it served Syndicate. It does not
  reopen the 2026-08-02 relay-architecture decision (Rust service, Cloudflare
  rejected); Railway is the answer to *where the chosen relay runs*, which
  that decision never fixed. The relay's repository configuration migrated
  locally from deprecated `railway.json` to `.railway/railway.ts` on 2026-09-01
  with a validated service graph; production cleared the legacy Config File
  setting, added managed PostgreSQL, injected its private `DATABASE_URL`, and
  placed both services in `us-west2`. The final IaC plan is clean. Railway
  canonicalizes its default-equivalent restart fields out of the desired graph;
  its live manifest retains `ON_FAILURE` with ten retries. The Cloud Run path
  (`cloudbuild.yaml`, `deploy.sh`, Artifact Registry) is retired.

### 1.3 The premise that died, and what it costs

Syndicate was separated from the Packet\* product family on 2026-08-27, and
its execution-target integration was deleted from PacketBench (commit
`68ce85ee`; the archived program doc is
`dev/archive/syndicate/syndicate-execution-target.md`). Two statements this
document made at pause time are now **false and are withdrawn**:

- ~~"PacketRelay is live production infrastructure for the **Syndicate**
  execution target (product-route WSS deployed on Cloud Run)."~~ The relay is
  PacketBench's, and its deployment target is Railway.
- ~~"Syndicate work continues and will change the relay under this program's
  feet — that drift is expected."~~ There is no Syndicate work touching the
  relay. The drift this program planned around does not exist, and the pickup
  step that handled it is retired (see §6, step 3).

**The consequence, recorded plainly: Remote Agents now bears 100% of the
relay's build and run cost.** While the relay served Syndicate, its
implementation work (control plane, PostgreSQL state, auth, replay, audit,
Web Push) and its hosting bill were shared against another program's value.
They are not any more. That is a real reweighting of this program's economics
and it has not been scored anywhere — the sprint plan in
`06-implementation-plan.md` still allocates relay work as if it were partly
someone else's. This is stated as a consequence, not as an argument for or
against the program.

The separation also raised the disposition of the relay's `/v1/product-route`
surface. That was recorded here as an open relay-repo question on the
understanding that the route backed a live Syndicate deployment. **That
understanding was wrong.** The owner confirmed on 2026-08-28 that the route is
not serving live traffic, and the decision is to **cut it** — see
`09-open-decisions.md` § Relay `/v1/product-route` disposition. The removal was
completed in the relay repo at `b2bcff5`, before the Railway deployment.

## 2. State of record

### Implementation: Sprint 0 complete

The implementation-zero statement was accurate through 2026-08-31. Sprint 0
completed on 2026-09-01 with the shared protocol package, PWA skeleton,
workspace build wiring, feature-gated PacketRelay route/protocol skeleton,
isolated desktop feature flag, ownership map, and verified Railway/PostgreSQL
substrate. These are foundations only: Remote Agents remains disabled and
fail-closed, and Sprint 1/product auth has not started.

### Planning: complete

Thirteen markdown docs (01–11, README, research-brief) plus two HTML war-room
briefs (~110 KB). The implementation plan is seven sprints (0–6) sized for a
six-agent team with separate write areas (Rust Relay/Data, Desktop Remote
Gateway, Backend Conversation Service, PWA, Security/Auth, QA/Protocol/Docs/
Release). V1 capacity targets: 1 desktop socket per host, ≤5 mobile clients,
≤20 active conversations, 1,000-event/24h replay buffer, 64 KiB inline
envelope ceiling.

### Decision ledger (current)

| Decision | State |
| --- | --- |
| Primary UX: cloud sign-in, QR not primary | **Locked** |
| Desktop owns execution; relay never calls providers/tools | **Locked** |
| PWA first; native iOS deferred until after PWA beta | **Locked** |
| MVP runtime scope: API agents only, no remote PTY | **Locked** |
| Transport: WS relay for control, Web Push wake-only | **Locked** |
| Relay: extend `D:\projects\packetrelay` (Rust/Tokio + PostgreSQL); Cloudflare rejected | **Resolved 2026-08-02** — must not be reopened implicitly |
| Code location: relay stays sibling repo; shared schemas + PWA under PacketBench `remoteagents/` | **Resolved 2026-08-02** |
| **Relay ownership** | **Resolved 2026-08-27** — PacketRelay is PacketBench's infrastructure; Remote Agents is its only consumer. Not shared with Syndicate. |
| **Relay deployment target** | **Resolved 2026-08-27** — Railway (replaces Cloud Run). Does not reopen the 2026-08-02 architecture decision. |
| Payload-encryption launch gate | **Resolved 2026-08-16** — plaintext (TLS-only) for local/internal dev only; encrypted agent/approval/file payloads are a hard gate before any external private beta. Unchanged by the resumption. |
| **Auth provider** | **Resolved 2026-08-28** — build passkey/magic-link auth into the relay (Rust on PostgreSQL), fully owned. The owner accepted the ownership burden explicitly. No blocking owner decision remains. See §2 and `09-open-decisions.md` § Auth Provider. |
| Railway deployment questions (edge WS connection lifetime, deploy-time instance overlap, managed-PostgreSQL durability, region) | **Verified 2026-09-01** — WSS indefinite even idle; overlap defaults to `0`; relay and PostgreSQL in `us-west2`; PostgreSQL is live privately but PITR-off single-node durability is internal-only until PITR, scheduled volume backups, and an offsite logical restore drill. See `02-architecture.md` |
| Relay `/v1/product-route` disposition after the Syndicate separation | **Resolved and DONE 2026-08-28** — cut, executed in the relay repo as `b2bcff5`. Bridge/broadcast/room were explicitly *not* cut; they are a separate inherited lineage. |
| Backend conversation persistence shape | Open, non-blocking (recommendation written: minimal Rust DTO for MVP) |
| Native iOS strategy | Deferred until after PWA beta |
| Team/org model, cloud runner, billing, WebRTC/LAN, remote PTY, file browser depth, transcript retention | Deferred |

### The auth decision — RESOLVED 2026-08-28

**Option 3 was chosen: build it into the relay.** Passkey/magic-link in Rust
on PostgreSQL, fully owned, with the owner explicitly accepting the ownership
burden that implies. This was the last blocking owner decision; Sprint 0 is
unblocked.

It stayed open through the whole pause — nothing about it was answered or
rejected between 2026-08-16 and 2026-08-27 — and was resolved the day after
the program resumed. "Buy" had been clarified into two sub-flavors during the
2026-08-16 blocker review. The full menu is retained below as the record of
what was weighed:

1. **Hosted SaaS IdP** (Clerk / Auth0 / Stytch class) — vendor runs sign-in,
   passkeys, magic links, recovery; the relay only validates tokens. Least
   owned surface; free tiers cover a private beta, then per-active-user
   pricing. *This was the 2026-08-16 session's recommendation.*
2. **Self-hosted open-source IdP** (Keycloak / Zitadel / Ory class) —
   standard OIDC, no vendor or per-user fees, but one more service to deploy,
   patch, and secure next to the relay.
3. **Build into the relay** — passkey/magic-link in Rust on PostgreSQL; fully
   owned including the WebAuthn ceremony, session design, recovery flows, and
   the security review those imply. **← CHOSEN 2026-08-28.**
4. **Dev-only identity** — permitted for internal smoke tests regardless of
   the above; never for any external user.

Options 1 and 2 remain the fallbacks if in-house auth lands more expensive
than expected — most likely at account recovery or at the pre-beta security
review. If either is ever taken, re-survey the vendor field rather than
reusing the 2026-06 comparison: pricing and passkey support move fast. Option
4 is unaffected and still appropriate as the internal-prototype scaffold.

### Corrections applied at pause time

- **The `packet-relay` path bug is fixed.** Every planning doc previously
  cited the relay repo as `D:\projects\packet-relay`; the real directory is
  `D:\projects\packetrelay` (the *crate* is named `packet-relay`, which is how
  the error propagated). Corrected 2026-08-16 in: `backlog.md`,
  `dev/mobile/README.md`, all `dev/remoteagents/*.md`, and both HTML briefs.
  Left intact as dated evidence: `docs/reports/state-of-the-ade-2026-07-30.md`
  line ~66 — do not "fix" dated audit snapshots.

## 3. Why it was paused — and what changed

The pause reasoning, preserved:

- The portfolio's bottleneck was **packaged, real-environment proof**, not new
  surfaces — the owner rejected the v1.0.0 definition the same day and chose
  to continue the 0.10.x proof/hardening cadence. Remote Agents is the
  largest possible new surface (XL: relay control plane + desktop gateway +
  conversation service + PWA + auth + E2EE).
- The pause was **strategic sequencing, not doubt about the design**. The
  market validated the architecture: Claude Remote Control and Codex-in-
  ChatGPT-mobile both ship exactly this shape (execution local, phone as a
  thin approval window over a relay).

What changed on 2026-08-27: the owner unpaused the program, and PacketRelay
became PacketBench's own infrastructure with Railway as its deployment target
(§1.2). No rationale beyond those decisions was recorded, and none is invented
here. The sequencing argument above is preserved as the reason the pause
happened, not as a live objection to the program running now.

## 4. What aged during the pause — the staleness map

Read this table before trusting any doc.

| Artifact | Trust at resume |
| --- | --- |
| `09-open-decisions.md` | **Authoritative** — the live decision ledger. |
| `01-product-scope.md`, `04-security.md`, `05-pwa.md`, `06-implementation-plan.md`, `07-six-agent-runbook.md`, `08-testing.md` | Design of record; sound unless a resume step below invalidates a specific assumption. `06`'s sprint sizing predates the cost reweighting in §1.3. |
| `02-architecture.md`, `03-protocol.md` | Design of record, re-baselined against `D:\projects\packetrelay` after `/v1/product-route` was removed at `b2bcff5`. `02` carries the answered Sprint 0 Railway deployment verifications and the remaining external-beta durability gate. |
| `research-brief.md` | **Background only.** Dated 2026-05-26 — three months older than the rest and predates the Cloudflare→Rust reversal. Re-verify its platform facts before consuming: iOS PWA Web Push behavior, WebAuthn/passkey support matrices, WS connection limits, push-provider choices. |
| The two HTML briefs | Presentation snapshots of the plan; never authoritative over the markdown. They never carried the pause status and they predate the 2026-08-27 decisions, so they say nothing about relay ownership or Railway. Regenerate them only if they are used for a kickoff. |
| Market baseline | Refresh now. As of 2026-08-16 the first parties ship phone supervision (Claude Remote Control, Codex mobile QR pairing, GitHub mission control mobile); the "Ten Empty Lanes" strategy report (artifact, 2026-08-16) argues the differentiated version of this surface is **the attention-budget's remote endpoint, not a desktop mirror** — Lane 10: urgency-typed interruptions, decision windows, batched approvals, voice triage via Dictation. |

## 5. Invariants

Do not violate these without an explicit new owner decision:

1. Desktop PacketBench owns execution, providers, models, secrets, workspaces,
   permissions. The cloud never calls a provider or runs a tool.
2. **No generic remote Tauri invoke bridge.** A small audited command set
   only, wrapping the existing `api-agent:*` event vocabulary — never a
   second event vocabulary and never a general RPC surface.
3. API agents only in MVP; raw PTY remote control is out.
4. PWA first at `remote.packetbench.app`; account sign-in primary (QR at most a
   later convenience).
5. The relay is the Rust service at `D:\projects\packetrelay`, owned by
   PacketBench and deployed on Railway; no Cloudflare implementation, and the
   2026-08-02 decision is not reopened by creating one.
6. The ratified E2EE gate: encrypted agent/approval/file payloads before any
   external private beta.
7. Web Push is wake-only; the WS relay is the control channel.

## 6. Resume runbook (ordered)

0. **Read** this doc, then `09-open-decisions.md`, then `README.md`.
1. ~~**Decide auth**~~ — **done 2026-08-28**: build passkey/magic-link into
   the relay. No blocking owner decision remains. Carry the owned surface
   listed in `09-open-decisions.md` § Auth Provider into Sprint 0 sizing; the
   pre-beta security review is a gate alongside E2EE, not a nice-to-have.
2. ~~**Confirm the E2EE gate still stands.**~~ **Confirmed:** it was
   owner-ratified 2026-08-16 and remains unchanged.
3. ~~**Cut `/v1/product-route` in the relay repo, then re-baseline
   `02-architecture.md` / `03-protocol.md` against `D:\projects\packetrelay`
   HEAD, once.**~~ **Done 2026-08-28** at `packetrelay@b2bcff5`. This step was
   not about tracking Syndicate drift — that premise is dead (§1.3):

   a. **The inherited surface was removed.** `/v1/product-route`, its dedicated
      crypto/protocol modules and document, and the retired Cloud Run artifacts
      came out. Bridge/broadcast/room remain as a separate lineage and were
      explicitly outside the cut.
   b. **The plan was re-baselined** against the remaining relay surface in
      `02-architecture.md`, `03-protocol.md`, and `09-open-decisions.md`.
4. ~~**Complete Railway deployment verification.**~~ **Done 2026-09-01.** The
   IaC migration is applied with a clean final plan; managed PostgreSQL is live
   over private `DATABASE_URL`; both services are in `us-west2`; WSS is
   indefinite even idle and live legacy smoke passed; overlap defaults to `0`.
   PostgreSQL durability remains an external-beta gate: enable PITR, schedule
   volume backups, and pass an offsite logical-dump restore drill.
5. **Refresh the research brief's platform facts** (30–60 min web sweep):
   iOS PWA push, passkey UX, WS limits, and the first-party competitor
   baseline (what Claude/Codex/GitHub mobile now ship).
6. **Re-scope against Lane 10.** Explicit product decision: is v1 a
   supervision mirror (the 01-product-scope MVP as written) or the
   attention-budget remote endpoint (urgency-typed queue, decision windows,
   batched approvals)? The Ten Empty Lanes report argues the latter is the
   defensible version. Amend `01-product-scope.md` if the answer changes it.
7. **Confirm team shape, with §1.3's cost reweighting in view.** The sprint
   plan assumes six parallel agents with separate write areas
   (`07-six-agent-runbook.md`) and was sized when relay work was shared with
   another program. If picking up with less capacity, re-cut the sprint plan
   before starting, don't improvise.
8. ~~**Verify Sprint 0 prerequisites.**~~ **Done 2026-09-01:** PostgreSQL is
   live for durable state and the shared/relay contract fixtures gate the two
   repositories as described in `09-open-decisions.md` § Code Location. Retain
   the external-beta database durability gate above. Web Push key strategy is a
   later push-implementation decision, not a reason to reopen Sprint 0.
9. ~~**Run Sprint 0** per `06-implementation-plan.md`.~~ **Complete
   2026-09-01.** Remote Agents remains disabled/fail-closed in production;
   Sprint 1 and product auth have not started.

- Program docs: this directory (`dev/remoteagents/`), `01`–`11` + README.
- Relay repo: `D:\projects\packetrelay` (crate `packet-relay`; Rust 1.83,
  Dockerfile, `.railway/railway.ts` deployment configuration, and a CI
  workflow; the Cloud Run artifacts were removed on 2026-08-28).
- Task register: `backlog.md` § Owner decisions (the auth entry is resolved
  2026-08-28) and the Remote Agents rows in `ROADMAP.md`.
- Strategy context: the "Ten Empty Lanes" artifact (2026-08-16, Lane 10 and
  §5 Sequencing) and the "Forty Plans, One Gate" plan-review artifact
  (2026-08-16) — both in the owner's artifact gallery.
- Sibling background: `dev/mobile/` is superseded research; its Cloudflare
  conclusions are dead, its PWA-first/account-first conclusions survived.
- Syndicate background: archived at
  `dev/archive/syndicate/syndicate-execution-target.md`; the integration was
  removed from PacketBench in commit `68ce85ee`.
